    In general, the alignment algorithm want to **minimize** the cost.

    Some metrics in their canonical form are maximized when perfectly aligned 
    (e.g., mi and hel). These are usually negated when output by `-allcost`, 
    so that ALL cost (EXCEPT lss) values will decrease when alignment improves 
    (given that the base/source contrasts are valid as required by the metric, 
    e.g., lpc is ONLY meaningful if the base and source have opposite contrast).
    This behavior can be verified by manually applying a transform to a image.

    BASED ON GLOBAL CORRELATION COEFFICIENT
    ls : 1 - abs(Pearson corrcoef), near zero
    sp : 1 - abs(Spearman corrcoef), near zero
    lss (maximized): Pearson corrcoef, near one (the ONLY exception)

    BASED ON 2D JOINT HISTOGRAM
    mi (negated) : (negative) mutual information, large negative value
    nmi : 1/normalized MI, small positive value
    je : joint entropy, small positive value
    hel (negated) : (negative) Hellinger distance, large negative value
    crM : near zero
    crA : near zero
    crU : near zero

    BASED ON LOCAL (A FEW MM) PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (SIMILAR TO BOUNDARY-BASED METHODS)
    lpc : sum(w[i]*pc[i]*abs(pc[i])) / sum(w[i]), large negative value (FOR opposite contrast ONLY)
    lpa : 1 - abs(lpc), large negative value (FOR same contrast ONLY)
    lpc+ : lpc + hel*0.4 + crA*0.4 + nmi*0.2 + mi*0.2 + ov*0.4
    lpa+ : lpa + hel*1.0 + crA*0.4 + nmi*0.2 + mi*0.0 + ov*0.0
